## Screen Size and Composition

In here the objective is to understand two dominant factors relating with the experience, screen size and composition. In the end, possible solutions are suggested.

## Screen size

The medium in which the experience takes place is the screen. 

There are four kinds of common screens. These are mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screens.

In terms of spatial dimension of the screen, there are two measures. First is the physical size which is explained in inches. The second is resolution which is explained in pixels. 

The physical size defines the experience in terms of the way in which the screen appears in the field of view of the person watching it. 

The resolution defines the experience in terms of of the way how the contents of the screen is composed. 

Resolution particularly affects the composition of the content — how much is visible at any given time — and it’s precision and sharpness.

Over half of desktop displays are larger than 2 million pixels, and just few percentile are lower than 1 million pixels. 

The latest mobile devices are over 2 million pixels, with up to half below 1 million pixels. 

Tablets and laptop screens will mostly be of similar resolution, somewhere between the mobile devices and desktops.

It then follows that in terms of resolution, it is best to prepare for a screen size around 2 million pixels. This would be 1920x1080 on a desktop or laptop, and 1080x1920 on a laptop or mobile. 

The average screen resolution within a group of people will depend on location, affluence, interest in technology, and other factors. 

In terms of their size, mobile screens tend to be 6 inches or smaller.

Tablet screens tend to be between 7 and 12 inches.

Laptop screens tend to be between 11 and 16 inches. 

Desktop screens tend to be between 20 and 32 inches.

The size of the screen affects how clearly viewable (or readable) content is.

Due to the difference in the size of the screen, whereas a mobile screen can meaningfully display around 100 words at a time, a desktop screen can display over a 1000. 

Then it follows that the degree to which the audience is using desktop or larger laptop screen, has dramatic effect on production requirements.

## Composition

Composition deals with the way in which things are arranged on the screen.

There is a limited number of meaningful composition options.

Because the Lama is the main thing, the Lama must be part of the composition. The first option is “Lama only” composition. 

The second option is “Lama and content composition”, where content is for example an aspiration that is being recited together with the Lama. The content could also be a translator, a static image, or an animation showing how to perform something. It could be also a close up of Lama’s hands or something else that is happening in the physical space where the Lama is.

The third option is “Lama and audience”, where the audience is displayed on the screen in one form or the other together with the Lama.

Because there can be only Lama, some form of content, or the audience, and because Lama is the main thing, these three are the only possible split-screen compositions. 

Depending on the software, it might be possible to have audience take up some smaller part of the screen — for example on the top part of the screen — and then Lama and content splitting the rest. 

It does not appear meaningful to otherwise split the screen. Splitting the screen into three or more would make sense only if none of it involved text content.

Then it follows, that the most suitable split is the one where one side is the content, and the other side is the Lama. It seems more correct to have Lama on the left and content on the right. 

In the following section, the term “view” refers to the area which is reserved for content. This assumes that part of the screen is reserved for the Lama.

## Possible Solutions

An agnostic approach — the one most likely to be meaningful for all participants — is based on maximizing the number of words per view without making it hard to read it. 

In addition to reserving the entire view for text, there are several meaningful ways to optimize towards this goal, for example:

- Control type face (sans family fonts will work best for screen)
- Control type size
- Control line spacing
- Control margins

Out of these, controlling type face and margins are non-destructive in the sense that both improve one aspect without hurting the other. Type size and line spacing are destructive; where number of words per view increase, readability decrease. 

What is the right number of words then? It is likely to be not more than 100 words per view.

Imagine a 6 inch mobile screen, quickly becoming a norm for connected viewing in today’s world. Such screen is roughly 100 square centimeters. With 100 words in a view, on average the word has the physical space of 0.5 cm2.  On a larger tablet, there is 2 cm2 per word with 100 words per view. 

Here we are assuming no line spaces, no margins, and the entire view reserved for the text content.

Once a number of words per view is set, there are several ways for increasing readability without negatively affecting number of words per view.

Most important is color: 

- Use common colors (basically dark on light)
- Reduce color saturation (off-black with off-white)
- Use background and texture sparingly (subtlety is the key here)

There are other minor factors, for example structural elements — fine lines and such — but they will not play a significant role in the overall experience.

## Future Work

Establish, and document, and make available practitioner experience focused guidelines for online Dharma transmission.
