# Translation

Given that most teachings are given in Tibetan, and most people do not understand Tibetan, translation plays a central role in the experience people have in an online event.


## Two Approaches to Translation

The meaning of the term “translation” is to take something presented in one language, the root, and transfer it to another language, the target, so that it becomes comprehensible to anyone who understands the target (language). Generally speaking, there are two kinds of approaches to translating the Dharma:

- Word translation (Tib: tsig gyur)
- Meaning translation (Tib: dön gyur) 

In the case of word translation, the focus is on taking the words in the root language, and transferring it to the target language word-by-word. In the case of meaning translation, the focus is on taking the words in the root, and conveying the meaning in the target language. 

The main challenge with word-by-word translation is that it requires a high level of skill from the translator. The main challenge with conveying the meaning is that it requires the translator to have equal or greater understanding of the topic than the Lama. This is rarely the case. 

There is the additional point that while we can never know exactly what is meant by something that is said, we can know exactly the words that are being said.

## Basic Guidelines for Translation in Online Events

Translation in an online event is somewhat different from translating in live events (in physical spaces). Two of the most important differences are that 1) the one listening can only see the Lama, and not the translator, and 2) there is oftentimes one translator in the same physical space with the Lama, while others are online. The below guidelines help overcome typical issues arising from these two factors. 

First, points for avoiding issues arising from the fact that the one listening sees only the Lama, and not the translator, but hears both.

- Translator should not make any audible sounds while Lama is speaking
- Translator should eliminate background and other sources of sound, or use mute while Lama is speaking
- Once the Lama has stopped, the translator may ask questions to clarify
- Translator shall make small pause between the moment when Lama stops speaking and the translator starts speaking

In the case of the first point above, a translator may be tempted to respond audibly to Lama saying things such as "re wa" (isn't it). Such impulses should not be followed, but the translator should strictly remain silent whie the Lama is speaking.

Second, the case where one translator in the same physical space with the Lama, while others are online. This is typically caused by the case where the event is held in a physical location, where one translator is translating Lama's speach to the audience in that physical location. The points to avoid issues arising from such case:

- The translator connects to Zoom individually (i.e. is not part of the main audio)
- The translator is placed as far from the Lama as possible 
- A directional microphone is used for Lama audio

Take the example where there is English translation in the physical space. Failing to follow the above three points will result in all other translation audio channels having English translation audible on them as well, overlapping with the translation language they actually want to hear.

## Communication Between Translators

There should be an alternative communication channel available for translators. Something that is not creating additional distraction (e.g. Whatsapp) and is straightforward to follow (e.g. Discord or Slack).
