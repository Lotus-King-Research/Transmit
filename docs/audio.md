# Background

Something that film makers and other audio visual professionals learn early in their education is that audio is at least as important as video, or actually more important. This can be understood by a simple example. Imagine two online events, one where video quality is amazing, but sound quality is terrible, and other where there there is no video at all, but there is great audio quality. It is clear that in the latter the experience will be better.

## Experiential Objectives

- The audio should be crisp and clear
- When the Lama is speaking, only that should be audible
- When the translator is speaking, only that should be audible
