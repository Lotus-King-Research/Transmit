# Working with Poor Internet Connection

In most cases, issues arising from poor internet connectivity caused by remote location or other factors, can be mitigated pre-emptively. When internet connectivity issues arise before or during an online event, the key is to simplify the streaming setup as much as possible. The result of such simplification is two-fold; less internet bandwidth is required to achieve the same quality of audio and video, and there are less likely to be interruptions. Below, simple instructions are provided for achieving this. 

## An Overview of the Steps Required

1.1) Ensure that only one device connects to Zoom from the location

1.2) Disconnect any other devices connected to the same Wi-Fi 

1.3) The device that actually does connect to Zoom, must be a mobile phone

1.4) In case the phone use extermal microphone, it must be connected with cable

1.5) The device (that phone) is placed as close to the Lama as possible

1.6) Screenshare from different location

## A Detailed Explanation of Each Step

2.1) If just one device is connected to Zoom from the location, it means that the Lama's audio and video will be transmitted outwards, and nothing will be trasmitted inwards. For every additional device connected to Zoom from the location, Lama's audio and video will have to be transmitted inwards. In the case of translator, there will also be additional requirement to transmit outwards. The requirement to transmit outwards arising from the translator being connected from the location, can be reduced somewhat (but not entirely) by having the translator on mute during Lama's speech.

2.2) Mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices automatically connect to known Wi-Fi networks, and might cause the location's connection to slow down significantly even if they are not connected to Zoom and even if it seems that those devices are doing nothing. All devices should explicitly be disconnected from the location's Wi-Fi.

2.3) Mobile phones have many advantages over other devices in terms of online streaming. Firstly, mobile phones are able to readily switch between the Wi-Fi connection and the cellular connection in case the Wi-Fi has connection issues. Secondly, the hardware and software on mobile phones are optimized towards transmitting audio and video, whereas the hardware and software of laptops, tablets and other devices are not. Mobile phone offers far superior audio and video transmission capabilities compared to any other device. They should always be preferred over other options in the absence of dedicated live streaming studios setup by professionals.

2.4) In case an external microphone is used (with the mobile phone), it must be connected with a cable. Wireless microphones such as bluetooth microphones should not be used at all. Wireless devices are unreliable, difficult to troubleshoot without expert knowledge, and introduce noise that increase bandwidth consumption.

2.5) When a device or an external microphone is placed too far from the Lama, it results in "dissapearing voice" effect where it seems that the Lama's speech is fading away, as well as other audio quality problems. These can be easily confused as internet connectivity problems, when in fact they are caused by microphone placement or other factors related with the microphone. Typically audio quality problems will start manifesting when the microphone is placed one meter away, or further. But it can happen even when the microphone is placed nearer, particularly on laptops and other devices which are optimized towards the user of the device to use external audio peripherals such as a headset.

2.6) Screensharing requires much more from the internet connection than audio does, and almost as much as video. If screensharing is handled from a different location, it will not consume any bandwidth from the location with poor connection.
