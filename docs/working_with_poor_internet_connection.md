# Working with Poor Internet Connection

In most cases, issues arising from poor internet connectivity caused by remote location or other factors, can be mitigated pre-emptively. When internet connectivity issue arise before or during an online event, the key is to simplify the streaming setup as much as possible. Below, simple instructions are provided for how to do this.

## An Overview of the Steps Required

1.1) Ensure that only one device connects to Zoom from the location

1.2) Disconnect any other devices connected to the same Wi-Fi 

1.3) The device that actually does connect to Zoom, must be a mobile phone

1.4) In case the phone use extermal microphone, it must be connected with cable

1.5) The device (that phone) is placed as close to the Lama as possible

## A Detailed Explanation of Each Step

2.1) If just one device is connected to Zoom from the location, it means that the Lama's audio and video will be transmitted outwards, and nothing will be trasmitted inwards. For every additional device connected to Zoom from the location, Lama's audio and video will have to be transmitted inwards.

2.2) Mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices automatically connect to known Wi-Fi networks, and might cause the connection to slow down significantly even if they are not connected to Zoom and even if it seems that those devices are doing nothing. All devices should explicitly be disconnected from the Wi-Fi.

2.3) Mobile phones have many advantages over other devices in terms of online streaming. Firstly, mobile phones are able to readily switch between the Wi-Fi connection and the cellular connection in case the Wi-Fi has connection issues. The hardware and software on mobile phones are optimized towards transmitting audio and video, whereas the hardware and software of laptops, tablets and other devices are not. Mobile phone offers far superior audio and video transmission capabilities compared to any other devices. They should always be preferred over other options in the absence of dedicated, live streaming studios setup by professionals.

2.4) In case an external microphone is used (with the mobile phone), it must be connected with cable. Wireless microphones such as bluetooth microphones should not be.

2.5) When a device or an external microphone is placed too far from the Lama, it results in "dissapearing voice" where it seems that the Lama's speech is fading away, as well as other audio quality problems. These can be easily confused as internet connectivity problems, when in fact they are caused by microphone placement. Typically audio quality problems will start manifesting when the microphone is placed one meter away, or further. But it can happen even when the microphone is placed nearer, particularly on laptops and other devices that are optimized towards the user of the device to use external audio peripherals such as headset.
